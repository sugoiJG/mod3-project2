This basic Todo application was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create, update, and delete todo items with priority and due date.

## Features

- Create a new todo item with a description, priority, and due date.
- Update an existing todo item.
- Delete a todo item.
- View a list of all todo items.
- Click on a todo item to view its details.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database for storing todo items.
- Express: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- React: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for running the server.
- Tailwind CSS: CSS framework for styling the app.
